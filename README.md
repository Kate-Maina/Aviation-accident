# Aircraft Risk Assessment for Investment

# Introduction
As part of our company's strategic initiative to diversify its portfolio, we are exploring new industries. The specific focus is to purchase and operate aircraft for both commercial and private enterprises. There is a a significant challenhe, understanding the potential risks associated with the different tyoes of aircraft. Given the complexity of the aviation industry and the wide array of aircraft models, we have the critical task of determining which aircraft presents the least risk for investment. To ensure the success and saffety of this new business endeavor.

This project aims to address these challenges by assessing the risk of various aircraft models based on historical accident data. To help inform the decision making process, the primary goal is to identify the aircraft that are statisticallt associated with the lowest accident rates.

Through data analysis, we will identify key factors contributing to aircraft risk and offer actionable insights to support the head of the new aviation division in making informed, data-driven decisions. By focusing on aircraft with the lowest accident rates and understanding the underlying patterns, we can mitigate risks and ensure a safer and more profitable entry into the aviation industry.
