# Aircraft Risk Assessment for Investment

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze aviation accident data with the primary goal of identifying the aircraft that are statistically associated with the lowest risk. As part of the company's strategic initiative to diversify its portfolio, the insights generated will help inform the decision making process of the new aviation division about aircraft purchases for private or commercial purposes.

# Objectives

Through data analysis, we will identify key factors contributing to aircraft risk and offer actionable insights to support the head of the new aviation division in making informed, data-driven decisions. By focusing on aircraft with the lowest accident rates and understanding the underlying patterns, we can mitigate risks and ensure a safer and more profitable entry into the aviation industry.

# Business Understanding



# Data Understanding and Analysis
1. The source of our data is the AviationData.csv and USState_Codes.csv and are in the Data/ dicrectory.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running pip insrall -r requirements.txt
3. Proceed to open the Jupyter Notebook file aviation_analysis.ipynb
4. Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis and visualizations.

# Interactive Dashboard
Access the interactive dashboard here. It presents insights into aircraft accident frequency by type, the distribution of fatal injuries, and seasonal trends. The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to dive deeper into the data for detailed analysis.
